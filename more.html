            <h2> ABOUT MY INTERNSHIP</h2>
            <p>
                During my time at the University Library during my internship, I picked up some important lessons. One
                of the key takeaways was the importance of punctualityâ€”I always made it a point to be early, living by
                the mantra of the early bird catching the worm. I also made sure to listen attentively to my mentors and
                stay prepared for any tasks that came my way. When I made mistakes, I didn't shy away from them;
                instead, I took them as learning opportunities. I listened carefully to feedback, reflected on it, and
                made sure to correct my course of action accordingly.
