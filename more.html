            <h2> ABOUT MY INTERNSHIP</h2>
            <p>
                During my time at the University Library during my internship, I picked up some important lessons. One
                of the key takeaways was the importance of punctualityâ€”I always made it a point to be early, living by
                the mantra of the early bird catching the worm. I also made sure to listen attentively to my mentors and
                stay prepared for any tasks that came my way. When I made mistakes, I didn't shy away from them;
                instead, I took them as learning opportunities. I listened carefully to feedback, reflected on it, and
                made sure to correct my course of action accordingly.

                            <hr>
                            In my tasked as being in digitization is I learned on how to be patience and make the work neat like when Scanning the Thesis which is around 50 books
                            from February to May. And when it comes to Technical I learned on how to be always careful especially when you are handling computer and electricity because
                            when we're not careful it may cost some accident and we are liable for any damage we gonna cost, that why our mentor always told us to be careful. And to Content And 
                            Programming I showed my talent in content like making some edit using Canva and in programming is to showcase my programming skills like helping the programming team.
